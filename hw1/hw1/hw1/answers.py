**Your answer:**

1. False. The test set is used to estimate the model's out-of-sample error, not the in-sample error.
the in-sample error is calculated using the training set.


2. False. not all splits are equally useful. The split as to be random. And the training set should have enough data to train the model. (commonly 70-30, 80-20) 

3. True. We can think of cross-validation as part of the tarining so we will not use test set during cross-validation
bescause we want to keep the model unbiased in respect to the test set.

4. True ,running the model on the validation-set provide an estimate of how the model will perform on unseen data
"""

part1_q2 = r"""
**Your answer:**


No, as we mentioned earlier the test set is only used once and this is only to estimate the models performance on unseen data.
Using test set for hyperparameter tuning may couse overfitting.
Insted we can split the training set to training and validation set and use the validation set for hyperparameter tuning.
